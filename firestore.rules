/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the collaborative vocabulary learning application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data and a shared-access model for collaborative sessions.
 * Data is segregated into user-specific paths, public collections, and session-specific subcollections to optimize security and performance.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/personalVocabulary/{personalVocabularyId}: Stores user's personal vocabulary, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}: Stores sessions created by a user, accessible only to that user.
 * - /public_sessions/{sessionId}: Stores public sessions, readable by anyone.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}/vocabularyCards/{vocabularyCardId}: Stores vocabulary cards within a session.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under the /users/{userId} path.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Public sessions are stored in a separate top-level collection for public read access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Public sessions are stored in `/public_sessions` and have the `hostId` denormalized for querying.
