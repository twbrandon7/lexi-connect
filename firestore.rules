/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model, combining path-based ownership for user data with attribute-based access control for shared resources.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/personalVocabulary/{personalVocabularyId}:  Personal vocabulary, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}: Collaborative learning sessions. Access control is determined by the 'visibility' field (public/private) and hostId.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}/vocabularyCards/{vocabularyCardId}: Vocabulary cards within sessions. Access control is based on session visibility and card ownership (creatorId).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own profiles and personal vocabulary.
 * - Public sessions are readable by anyone, but modifications are restricted to the session host.
 * - Private sessions are only accessible to the host.
 * - Listing of /sessions is public to support discovery of public sessions.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Session` document's `hostId` field is used for authorization, avoiding extra reads.
