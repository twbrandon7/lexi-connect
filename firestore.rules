/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Collaborative Vocabulary Learning App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data and a
 * collaborative model for shared sessions.  It uses denormalization to avoid
 * complex queries and ensures that only authorized users can access or modify
 * data. Public and private sessions are stored in separate collections to
 * optimize security and performance.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.  Only the authenticated user can
 *   access their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/personalVocabulary/{personalVocabularyId}: Stores user's
 *   vocabulary cards. Only the authenticated user can manage their own vocabulary.
 * - /users/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}: Private sessions created by a user.
 *   Only the owning user can manage these sessions.
 * - /public_sessions/{sessionId}: Public sessions accessible to all users. Must
 *   have `visibility` field set to `public`.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}/vocabularyCards/{vocabularyCardId}: Vocabulary cards
 *   within a specific session.  Access controlled by session membership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents.
 * - Users can only manage their own personal vocabulary.
 * - Public sessions are readable by anyone, but only the host can modify them.
 * - Data validation is relaxed for prototyping, focusing on authorization and
 *   relational integrity rather than comprehensive schema validation.
 * - List operations are secured based on path-based ownership or public
 *   visibility, avoiding costly queries in the rules.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Public Sessions: The `hostId` is denormalized into the `public_sessions`
 *   collection to allow for owner-based access control without extra reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public vs. Private Sessions: Stored in separate collections (`/public_sessions`
 *   vs. `/users/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}`) to allow for simpler and more
 *   performant list operations and access control.
